# Commands for GDB to execute

# Set breakpoints if needed, e.g.:
# b main
# b ZoneServer::initialize

# Run the program
r

# If you want to do something after the program starts, e.g., print a variable:
# print variable_name

# If you want GDB to exit after running, add 'quit'.
# Otherwise, it will enter interactive mode after the program exits or hits a breakpoint.
# quit
